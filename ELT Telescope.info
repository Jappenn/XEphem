'Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) - 

The technology available for the manufacture of mirrors places a limit,a fact very important,
around 8 meters in diameter, 
for those made up of a single piece. The next large telescopes, such as the Gran Telescopio Canarias
and the Southern African Large Telescope, involve a tightly packed set of hexagonal mirrors,allowing
a major power,
to form a composite mirror over the 10 m such as in diameter. The ELT will use this same approach, with adaptive optics systems
capable of compensating for the disturbances of atmospheric turbulence and making effective all 
the potential made available by the large diameter.
